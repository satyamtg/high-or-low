# High or Low
High or Low is an Alexa Skill to play a number game with the user.

High or Low is an engaging game in which Alexa tells a number and you have to tell whether the number is higher or lower than the number Alexa told in the previous turn. Alexa starts by telling two random numbers and the game goes on after that. This game is designed to improve the response time of the brain and has 3 difficulty levels, namely Beginner, Moderate, and Hard.

Depending on the chosen difficulty level, the user will be given 3 lives, 2 lives, or single life. The randomness of the numbers will also vary for the different difficulty levels. The beginner level uses only positive numbers but the other two use both positive and negative numbers.

This game actually becomes fun if multiple people play together. A High Score is calculated for each session and players can try to beat each others' scores.

The skill is currently live at the Alexa India Store [here](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07QLHW2ST/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=high+or+low&qid=1555256063&s=digital-skills&sr=1-2-spell "Get High or Low").
